defmodule Unicode.Guards do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a set of guards that can be used with
  Elixir functions.

  Each guard operates on a UTF8 codepoint since
  the permitted operators in a guard clause
  are restricted to simple comparisons that do
  not include string comparators.

  The data that underpins these guards is generated
  from the Unicode character database and therefore
  includes a broad range of scripts well beyond
  the basic ASCII definitions.
